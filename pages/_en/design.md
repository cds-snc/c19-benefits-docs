Design stuff:

- We use plain language
  - We layout the pages clearly
- We put one question per page
  - We only present the questions that are relevant to this population
  - We use a consistent pattern of yes or no questions
- We ask questions people can answer
  - People easily stuck on tax questions
  - We ask questions about them not about taxes
- We provide a Paper and a Digital channel for the service
  - Tax-filers can choose between filing taxes with the enclosed form or by visiting a URL
