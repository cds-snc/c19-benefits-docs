This document describes how to continue development with this codebase ‚Äî as well as the app structure and the technologies used ‚Äî to make it easy to revive this work in the future.

We foresee two scenarios for continuing development:

1. Run the app and view all the pages in order to rebuild it using other technology
2. Continue development of this specific repository

(Note: if there‚Äôs anything not covered in here, get in touch with [@pcraig3](https://github.com/pcraig3) or [@charlesmorin](https://github.com/charlesmorin).)

## 1. Run the app and view all the pages

All you need to do here is run the app and then find all the URLs.

1. First, get it to boot up.
   - Check out "[Build and run](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits#build-and-run)" in the README.
   - The app will be running at [http://localhost:3005/](http://localhost:3005/).
2. A full list of URLs can be found in [`/config`<wbr>`/routes.config.js`](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/config/routes.config.js). They're pretty much in order, so you can see them all sequentially.

All good! Get yerself pizza. <span role="img" aria-label="pizza slice">üçï</span>

## 2. Continue using our repository

In order to pick up development after some arbitrary length of time, first you need to run the app, update all the npm dependencies, and then check that all the tests pass before doing anything else.

1. First, get it to boot up.
   - Check out "[Build and run](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits#build-and-run)" in the README.
   - The app will be running at [http://localhost:3005/](http://localhost:3005/).
2. Second, run the tests. If they all pass (they should), then you can continue.
   - Check "[Run tests](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits#run-tests)" in the README.
3. Update all the dependencies, as many will be out of date.
   - Follow our [Updating dependencies](https://github.com/cds-snc/cra-claim-tax-benefits/blob/master/docs/UPDATING-DEPENDENCIES.md) process
   - Fingers crossed it all works <span role="img" aria-label="crossed fingers">ü§û</span>
4. Heck yeah! Get devving!!!
