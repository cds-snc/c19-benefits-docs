[Find financial help during COVID-19](https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/) (the “Finder”) was built to help people living in Canada during the COVID-19 crisis. The finder helps people determine which government benefits programs best meet their needs.

After anonymously answering a few simple questions, individuals are presented with a personalized list of financial benefits available to them, based on their specific circumstances.

The Finder provides individuals with information on federal, provincial and territorial benefit programs available to them, including the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB), the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), and the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) top-up, as well as measures such as mortgage and student loan deferrals.

Guided by a set of [digital principles](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html), this tool was designed for and with users, to ensure they can get the accurate and timely information they need.

The [Canadian Digital Service (CDS)](https://digital.canada.ca/) partnered with [Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) and [Service Canada (SC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/service-canada.html) to build the Finder. Work started on March 23, 2020. On May 22, 2020 , after only 10 weeks of collaboration, the Finder was officially launched for public use.
