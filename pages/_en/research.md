## Introduction

The Claim Tax Benefits project was designed and developed with the needs of tax filers at the heart of every decision. Using generative design research methods, we developed an understanding of what tax filers need in order to file a tax return and access benefits. We then used evaluative methods such as usability testing to validate or challenge hypothesized solutions. The process of designing, testing, and iterating provided us with further insight into what works and what doesn’t when meeting tax filers’ needs in the context of a remote service.

Over the course of the partnership, we surveyed 152 people, conducted interviews and usability tests with 82 people, and conducted 13 studies. This is an abridged version of the full research report for this project. The full report includes all of the research insights and full methodology overview.

## Current state insights

### Tax filing as it stands today

Generative research is a category of design research methods that aim to produce deep understanding of an experience or behaviour in order to identify a problem to solve and to generate potential solutions. During the discovery and early alpha phase of this project, we used generative research to understand tax filers’ goals and the barriers they encounter when they set out to achieve them.

This project started in partnership with the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) within CRA. Two of our generative research studies focused on the experiences of tax clinic clients and another focused on the experiences of tax filers with limited mobility more broadly.

### Tax filing goals – What motivates someone with low income to file a tax return?

1. **To meet their responsibilities as Canadian residents or citizens and avoid punishment by CRA.**

For many, receiving benefit payments is not the primary motivation for filing a tax return. Participants felt a strong obligation to file a return as Canadian citizens or residents. Most assumed that failing to do so would result in some kind of negative sanction from the government.

2. **To get and maximize benefits**

At the tax clinic we interviewed tax filers who had planned tight monthly budgets according to the benefits they expected to receive, and knew exactly what they were going to spend their return on: children’s clothes, groceries, or paying off debt. They turned to the tax clinic for help because they trusted volunteers to get them all of the benefits they were eligible for.

3. **To access other programs that require proof of income**

Various social assistance programs external to CRA are income tested and require proof of having filed a tax return. Some clients visit tax clinics with the explicit purpose of obtaining proof of filing so that they can access other supports.



### Why tax filers seek in-person assistance

**Tax filers lack confidence in their own ability to file a return without making a mistake or omission.**

* Determining which steps to take, which information to divulge, and how to interpret eligibility criteria for individual claims and benefits is not intuitive: it requires background knowledge or research
* Tax filers with simple tax situations may have complex life situations that are difficult to communicate to CRA. The answers to seemingly simple questions, like “what was your address last year?” can be ambiguous for someone who is experiencing or recovering from a turbulent period in their life.

**This lack of confidence becomes a barrier because it is connected to a fear of negative outcomes.**

* Tax filers believe that mistakes in their tax return will result in negative outcomes such as financial penalties, legal action, or heightened future scrutiny from CRA. The participants we interviewed came to the tax clinic because they believed that they would make mistakes if they filed by themselves.

### In-person assistance is not always possible to reach

Our generative research indicated that lack of confidence acts as a barrier to filing and accessing benefits, and that free, in-person assistance offered at tax clinics helps tax filers overcome that barrier.

Physically getting to in-person assistance can be an insurmountable barrier to tax filing for some, while adding a layer of complexity to the process for others.Travelling outside the home can be particularly difficult and time consuming to coordinate for tax filers with mobility-related disabilities, especially when the task is time sensitive. For others, distance or lack of transportation makes it difficult to get to free, in-person services.

***“We come to the clinic so that they can help you do everything – all the math... if the computer can do \[it automatically] then maybe there’s a chance we could do it at home and just stay at home.”***

A tax filer might have difficulty accessing in-person services because:

* There is no clinic nearby, particularly in rural and remote areas
* There is no transportation to get to the clinic
* The tax clinic environment can be challenging for people with mental illnesses
* In-person services can be difficult to get to for people with disabilities

Of the 13.4 million individuals across Canada with income under $35,000 around 741,460 file returns through the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program each year. While brick and mortar tax clinics are effective for those who can reach them, program data indicates that expansion of the program is seeing diminishing returns of impact for investment.

## Future state

We know which features of tax clinics and other services work well for tax filers with low income and limited mobility: asking a limited number of simple, personalized questions, and providing guidance on how to complete the process.

To address mobility barriers we designed a service that does not include in-person touchpoints. It allows tax filers to complete and submit their return entirely online or by mail.

### What do tax filers need in order to file taxes without assistance?

While self-serve, remote tax filing services can help address the mobility barriers that make it difficult to access tax clinics, the absence of in-person assistance may present other channel-specific barriers. During alpha and beta phases of the project we used evaluative research methods such as validation and usability testing to uncover barriers unique to a remote service. Evaluative studies were conducted primarily with participants recruited at food banks, who had varying degrees of familiarity with different tax filing methods.

#### Tax filers need to feel confident that they will not get in trouble with the CRA if they do their taxes alone.

Tax filers make decisions based on what they think will help them avoid negative outcomes after their return is filed.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FPR1Uj0UpJfw2PREdZqxoBJ02BM-XxwmwBz83lYSwhvyVqYApwzcAfmxLB8TBKxTGa8rDw-Gh0KoxNINgQFYqxBnwAlQXHf_IpwOzEL7Atl1caUri6n5fi8V-vn5P7kbzEtWiLRE)

##### Present only the questions that are necessary and relevant to the tax filer

When completing a paper tax return, tax filers are presented with a long list of blank fields. Tax filers can feel overwhelmed by the apparent number of decisions about which boxes to fill out and whether they qualify for each benefit or credit.

The MVP Claim tax benefits service emulates the personalized guidance available at tax clinics by showing only questions that apply to tax filers with income under roughly $12,000 per year ($19,000 for individuals under 65) and simple tax situations. The online channel further eliminates questions that don’t apply based on answers to preceding questions.
