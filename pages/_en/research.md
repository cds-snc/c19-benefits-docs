## Introduction

The Claim Tax Benefits project was designed and developed with the needs of tax filers at the heart of every decision. Using generative design research methods, we developed an understanding of what tax filers need in order to file a tax return and access benefits. We then used evaluative methods such as usability testing to validate or challenge hypothesized solutions. The process of designing, testing, and iterating provided us with further insight into what works and what doesn’t when meeting tax filers’ needs in the context of a remote service.

Over the course of the partnership, we surveyed 152 people, conducted interviews and usability tests with 82 people, and conducted 13 studies. This is an abridged version of the full research report for this project. The full report includes all of the research insights and full methodology overview.

### Tax filing as it stands today

Generative research is a category of design research methods that aim to produce deep understanding of an experience or behaviour in order to identify a problem to solve and to generate potential solutions. During the discovery and early alpha phase of this project, we used generative research to understand tax filers’ goals and the barriers they encounter when they set out to achieve them.

This project started in partnership with the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP) within CRA. Two of our generative research studies focused on the experiences of tax clinic clients and another focused on the experiences of tax filers with limited mobility more broadly.
