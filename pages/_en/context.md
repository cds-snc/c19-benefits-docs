How can we help people with low income file taxes to access CRA benefits and refunds?

Much of the information needed to file a tax return is already known to CRA. At the same time, low-confidence tax filers are very worried about making mistakes when submitting a tax return. The concept behind this demo application is to provide a wizard-like tax filing experience: presenting the tax filer with information that CRA already has about them and having them to confirm it rather than asking them type it in.
