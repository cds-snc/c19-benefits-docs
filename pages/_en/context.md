Much of the information needed to file a tax return is already known to CRA. At the same time, low-confidence tax filers are afraid of making mistakes when submitting a tax return. The concept behind this demo application is to provide a wizard-like tax filing experience: presenting the tax filer with information that CRA already has about them and having them to confirm it rather than asking them type it in.

How can we help people with low income file taxes to access CRA benefits and refunds?
