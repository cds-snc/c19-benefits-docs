The CRA collects income tax from individuals and businesses. But many low income people do not owe taxes. Instead they are eligible for refunds as a result of tax benefits and credits.

Unfortunately many of these people do not receive a refund because they do not file taxes. Of those who do get refunds, many file with assistance from the [Community Volunteer Income Tax Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html) . This program hosts free clinics where volunteers file taxes for eligible people. Initially, the CDS/CRA partnership focused on increasing the capacity of the volunteer clinics.

Early research led to a change in direction. Research insights indicated a primary need for user-friendly tax-filing tools for low income Canadians. Through the partnership, the team learned that CRA already has most information that tax-filers include in their returns. Using this information, we aimed to design a service that provides a wizard-like tax filing experience: rather than requiring tax-filers to enter their information, the service presents information that the CRA already has, then asks tax-filers to confirm the information is correct.

Several blog posts discuss the work of the partnership:
