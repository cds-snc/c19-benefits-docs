# _Covid 19 benefits_ documentation

[_Find financial help during COVID-19_](https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/en/start) is an online tool to help Canadians find the Covid-19 related benefits they may be eligible for. This service was designed and developed by the [Canadian Digital Service (CDS)](https://digital.canada.ca/) in partnership with [Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html).

This repository contains companion documentation for the project and can be viewed at +TODO+.

## Editing the documentation

The documentation uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the [DOCter](https://github.com/cfpb/DOCter) theme.

DOCter needs Jekyll and other dependencies to run locally. These can be installed with Bundler by running the following commands.

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Run Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open it up in your browser: <http://localhost:4000/>

### \_config.yml
